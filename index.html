            <p class="para">Ryan Royce Minor is a firm believer that you are not going to read much more than this
                single line of his biography.
                If one was to indulge themselves in the particulars though - Ryan was born and raised mostly by the
                sunny shores of San Diego.
                Hobbies include immersing in the diverse culture of wine, basketball, perfecting the art of making
                balanced craft cocktails,
                web development and wandering nomadically across this sphere known as the planet Earth.
            </p>
            <p class="para">Professionally, Ryan has enjoyed several careers. In his youth he operated a tank in the
                United States Marine Corps.
                After his service, he worked for the Department of Veterans Affairs in a health care setting. Recently,
                he enjoyed a successful career
                as a bartender for several years working in different types of venues such as speakeasys, fine dining
                establishments, Vegas style nightclubs and even upscale yet eclectic wine parlors.

            </p>
            <p class="para">His passion these days is for Web Development and is still a firm believer that you did
                not read the entire biography.
